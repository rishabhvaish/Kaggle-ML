Predict how sales of weather-sensitive products are affected by snow and rain.

An in depth analysis of the kaggle competition with focus on following points - 
* EDA - Look at the variables, include graphical displays, talk about anything interesting you notice, potential issues.
* Linear Regression Model / Diagnostics - For this one model, discuss its summary, significance, diagnostics, etc. Interpret the results and coefficients in the context of OLS (it’s ok if the model is ultimately not “correct”)
* Improvements - stepwise selection, interactions, polynomials, AIC/BIC, shrinkage, GLM, etc. How the models improved. To find out, evaluate them through Kaggle
* Improvements / Extra Methods -  2 extra methods that are outside of the framework of GLM. Why is the method may be appropriate for this task. How the method works. Discuss results. Interpret them if appropriate/possible. Report the Kaggle Score for each method

Final Kaggle score - 0.098
